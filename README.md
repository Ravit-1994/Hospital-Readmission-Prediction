# Hospital Readmissions Prediction

### Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict 30-day hospital readmissions, providing actionable insights to reduce readmission rates and improve patient care.

### Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Hospital Readmissions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions)
- Includes patient demographics, clinical data, and readmission labels.

### Key Features
- Performed **EDA** to identify trends and key predictors.
- Built and compared models, including:
  - **Gradient Boosting** (Best Model: Accuracy - 60%, F1 - 0.51)
  - Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.
- Delivered actionable recommendations to healthcare providers.

### Project Structure
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for preprocessing and model training.
- **results/**: Visualizations and model performance metrics.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Programming**: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Modeling**: Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 Score
